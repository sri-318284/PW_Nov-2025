//var reassignment

var username="Babu";
username="Ravindran";

//let redeclaration not possible as it throws error like username' has already been declared :

let username="srikanth";
let username="Telka";
console.log("username value for let  after redeclaration is " + username);

//let  reassignment is possible

let username="Babu";
username="Ravindran";
console.log("username value for let after reassignment is " + username);
 */
//const redeclaration is not allowed as it throws syntax error like Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable 'username'.

/* const username="srikanth";
const username="Telka";
console.log("username value for const after redeclaration is " + username); */

//const   reassignment is not allowed as it throws  error like Assignment to constant variable.
